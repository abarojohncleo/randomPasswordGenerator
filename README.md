# randomPasswordGenerator

I really wanted to build this ever since I learned to program, I just don't have enough time for it until now. 

Simple password generator for all of your online accounts.  You can customize characters and lengths for your password.  
It still needs improvement on the copy-on-click for generated password though.
If you know and want to suggest it, leave a comment and I'll try my best to implement it.
